    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare this Greek beef soup recipe, first cut the beef into 5cm (2 inches) pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pot over high heat. Add the olive oil and beef and sauté, until nicely coloured.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped onions and carrots and sauté for 1 more minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the same pot approx. 1.5L of water. (The water should cover the ingredients.)</li>
        <li>Add the celery, potatoes, bay leaves, thyme and beef cube. Stir well with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Place the lid on, turn the heat down and let the beef soup simmer for approx. 2 hours. Check once in a while to remove the foam from the surface with a spoon. Add more water if needed as it evaporates.</li>
        <li>After the beef is done add the lemon juice, lemon zest, a splash of olive oil and season to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve while still warm with a slice of lemon and chopped thyme. Enjoy!</li>
